## KCL Module Weighter

Welcome to the world’s most horribly named repository! If you’re studying Computer Science at King’s College London, you can use this little ugly tool to calculate your final percentage mark as described [here](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/informatics/study/current/handbook/Progs/regs.aspx). Simply double-click the .jar, type in your modules (I’ve included all first-year and second-year modules on the list as well as some common third-year modules, so be sure to edit these to make sure the list is all fancy and accurate), click ‘Start’ and then type in your grades for each module. A fancy, unformatted little number will show up at the bottom right corner of that gigantic window of yours after you click on ‘Calculate’.

I wrote this because I haven’t written Java in well over a year and like to procrastinate.

What’s that? You’re a computer science student so naturally you want to take a look and perhaps make changes? Is it 2025 and have the grade specs changed since I made this and you’d like to, perhaps make changes? You think this is really ugly and the code is really badly written and you’d like to make changes? (I think you get the idea) That’s great! Here’s a few things to keep in mind (well actually just one at the moment):

- This is a Netbeans project. Hence all the weird ```nbproject``` files and all that extra jazz. I like Netbeans because I like being lazy about non-trivial UI generation. If you’d like to complain about my poor IDE choice please direct all your feedback to nothanks@wakachamo.com. Cheers!
